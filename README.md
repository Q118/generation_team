# Generation_Team

![](https://github.com/Q118/generation_team/blob/master/screenshot.png)

A software engineering team generator command line application to generate a team web page. One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, *how* we design our code is just as important as the code itself. In this homework assignment, our challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, I  also ensured that all unit tests pass.
